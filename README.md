Cultural Signature Token (CST) Standard – community-guarded value recognition framework
# CST Standard (v1)

**Cultural Signature Token Standard**

---

## Overview

The CST (Cultural Signature Token) Standard defines a framework for minting digital tokens backed by **physical and intellectual cultural heritage**, under **community guardianship** rather than centralized ownership.

The standard is designed to enable value creation **without immediate financial barriers**, allowing communities to recognize, protect, and support cultural and creative contributions through transparent, ethical mechanisms.

CST is not a currency standard.  
CST is a **value-recognition and minting standard**.

---

## Purpose

The CST Standard was created to address a fundamental imbalance in traditional systems:

- Cultural and intellectual creators face **high upfront costs** (patents, registrations, legal fees)
- Communities lack tools to **collectively recognize and protect value**
- Existing systems prioritize enforcement over ethics

CST proposes an alternative path:
- Community-first recognition
- Ethical deterrence instead of coercion
- Transparent minting linked to real cultural value

---

## Core Principles

1. **Community Guardianship**  
   Assets referenced under CST are not owned by the protocol, but placed under community guardianship.

2. **Value Before Monetization**  
   Recognition precedes financial extraction. Minting is possible without immediate market sale.

3. **Physical & Intellectual Heritage**  
   CST supports:
   - Physical cultural artifacts
   - Intellectual creations
   - Creative works
   - Descriptive disclosures (e.g. inventions, methods, artistic concepts)

4. **Non-Coercive Protection**  
   CST does not enforce rights through courts or force.
   Ethical notice and public signaling act as deterrence.

5. **Transparency by Default**  
   All references, minting events, and guardianship actions are publicly verifiable.

## What CST Is Not

- ❌ Not a patent replacement  
- ❌ Not a legal enforcement mechanism  
- ❌ Not a financial instrument by default  
- ❌ Not a speculative token model  

CST does **not** promise exclusivity, profit, or legal immunity.

---

## Minting Logic (High-Level)

Minting under CST may occur when:
- A cultural or intellectual contribution is voluntarily submitted
- The community acknowledges its value
- Guardianship conditions are accepted

Minted tokens may be allocated between:
- The contributor
- The community
- Operational reserves

Exact distribution rules are **governance-defined** and subject to future versions.

## Relationship to Tartarys

The CST Standard operates under the constitutional principles described in the **Tartarys Whitepaper**.

- Tartarys provides the governance and ethical framework
- CST provides a technical and conceptual standard

The two are intentionally separated.

---

## Versioning

- **v1** – Conceptual and ethical specification  
- **v2+** – Governance refinement, extended models, optional smart contract reference  

Changes to the standard require transparent community discussion.

---

## Status

This document represents **CST v1**.

It is intentionally minimal.

Future iterations will be shaped by community insight, not unilateral authority.

## Contact

For context and governance framework, see the Tartarys Whitepaper repository.

This standard is released into public view under community guardianship.
